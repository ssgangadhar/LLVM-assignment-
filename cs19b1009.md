In stcpy-test.c
stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (a, b), c), d), e)
stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (a, b), c), d), e)
stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (a, b), c), d), e)
stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (a, b), c), d), e)
stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (stpcpy (a, b), c), d), e)

when  i saw this code i really suprised why they didn't use any loops here.
3)
template <> struct ScalarEnumerationTraits<RetainCountConventionKind> 

template <> struct MappingTraits<Param> 

template <> struct ScalarEnumerationTraits<FactoryAsInitKind> 
 ...etc 
these are template methods scalar enumerations and mapping traits which are used as data type whose domain values are given in a list or ordered list and who's only operations are equality and assignment .


4)
class ASTPrinter : public ASTConsumer
